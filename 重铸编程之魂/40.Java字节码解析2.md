1. 题目：字节码文件解析2

2. 解析内容

```c
ClassFile {
    u2             access_flags;
    u2             this_class;
    u2             super_class;
    u2             interfaces_count;
    u2             interfaces[interfaces_count];
    u2             fields_count;
    field_info     fields[fields_count];
    u2             methods_count;
    method_info    methods[methods_count];
    u2             attributes_count;
    attribute_info attributes[attributes_count];
}
```

3. Fields

```c
field_info {
    u2             access_flags;
    u2             name_index;
    u2             descriptor_index;
    u2             attributes_count;
    attribute_info attributes[attributes_count];
}
```


| Flag Name | Value | Interpretation |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ACC_PUBLIC | 0x0001 | Declared public; may be accessed from outside its package. |
| ACC_PRIVATE | 0x0002 | Declared private; usable only within the defining class. |
| ACC_PROTECTED | 0x0004 | Declared protected; may be accessed within subclasses. |
| ACC_STATIC | 0x0008 | Declared static. |
| ACC_FINAL | 0x0010 | Declared final; never directly assigned to after object construction (JLS §17.5). |
| ACC_VOLATILE | 0x0040 | Declared volatile; cannot be cached. |
| ACC_TRANSIENT | 0x0080 | Declared transient; not written or read by a persistent object manager. |
| ACC_SYNTHETIC | 0x1000 | Declared synthetic; not present in the source code. |
| ACC_ENUM | 0x4000 | Declared as an element of an enum. |

4. Methods

```c
method_info {
    u2             access_flags;
    u2             name_index;
    u2             descriptor_index;
    u2             attributes_count;
    attribute_info attributes[attributes_count];
}
```

| Flag Name | Value | Interpretation |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ACC_PUBLIC | 0x0001 | Declared public; may be accessed from outside its package. |
| ACC_PRIVATE | 0x0002 | Declared private; accessible only within the defining class. |
| ACC_PROTECTED | 0x0004 | Declared protected; may be accessed within subclasses. |
| ACC_STATIC | 0x0008 | Declared static. |
| ACC_FINAL | 0x0010 | Declared final; must not be overridden (§5.4.5). |
| ACC_SYNCHRONIZED | 0x0020 | Declared synchronized; invocation is wrapped by a monitor use. |
| ACC_BRIDGE | 0x0040 | A bridge method, generated by the compiler. |
| ACC_VARARGS | 0x0080 | Declared with variable number of arguments. |
| ACC_NATIVE | 0x0100 | Declared native; implemented in a language other than Java. |
| ACC_ABSTRACT | 0x0400 | Declared abstract; no implementation is provided. |
| ACC_STRICT | 0x0800 | Declared strictfp; floating-point mode is FP-strict. |
| ACC_SYNTHETIC | 0x1000 | Declared synthetic; not present in the source code. |

5. Attributes

```c
attribute_info {
    u2 attribute_name_index;
    u4 attribute_length;
    u1 info[attribute_length];
}
```
