#### Outputs

Channel 0 is connected directly to IRQ0, so it is best to use it only for purposes that should generate interrupts. Channel 1 is unusable, and may not even exist. Channel 2 is connected to the PC speaker, but can be used for other purposes without producing audible speaker tones.

#### Channel 2

The output of PIT channel 2 is connected to the PC speaker, so the frequency of the output determines the frequency of the sound produced by the speaker. This is the only channel where the gate input can be controlled by software (via bit 0 of I/O port 0x61), and the only channel where its output (a high or low voltage) can be read by software (via bit 5 of I/O port 0x61). Details of how to program the PC speaker can be found here.

#### Usage

```c
 //Play sound using built-in speaker
 static void play_sound(uint32_t nFrequence) {
 	uint32_t Div;
 	uint8_t tmp;
 
        //Set the PIT to the desired frequency
 	Div = 1193180 / nFrequence;
 	outb(0x43, 0xb6);
 	outb(0x42, (uint8_t) (Div) );
 	outb(0x42, (uint8_t) (Div >> 8));
 
        //And play the sound using the PC speaker
 	tmp = inb(0x61);
  	if (tmp != (tmp | 3)) {
 		outb(0x61, tmp | 3);
 	}
 }
 
 //make it shut up
 static void nosound() {
 	uint8_t tmp = inb(0x61) & 0xFC;
     
 	outb(0x61, tmp);
 }
 
 //Make a beep
 void beep() {
 	 play_sound(1000);
 	 timer_wait(10);
 	 nosound();
          //set_PIT_2(old_frequency);
 }
```
